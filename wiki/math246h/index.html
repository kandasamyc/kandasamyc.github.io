For problems that deal with some concentration \(C(t)\) of a certain mass \(S(t)\) in a volume \(V(t)\) and there is some flow \(F(t)\) both in and out
\[\frac{dS}{dt} = F_{in}C_{in} - F_{out}C_{out}\]
If the volume stays constant, \(C_{out}\) is a constant, otherwise, it should be rewritten in terms of \(S\) and \(t\) by determining an equation for \(V(t)\) from the difference in \(F_{in}\) and \(F_{out}\).</p><h2 id=numerical-methods>Numerical Methods<a href=#numerical-methods class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><h3 id=euler-s-method>Euler&rsquo;s Method<a href=#euler-s-method class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>One can use explicit Euler&rsquo;s method to estimate a function \(y\) at \(n\) steps of \(h\) from the initial value.
\[y_{n+1} = y_n + hf(t_n,y_n)\]</p><h2 id=exact-differential-form>Exact Differential Form<a href=#exact-differential-form class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><h3 id=formal-work>Formal Work<a href=#formal-work class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>We want a solution to a first order equation in the form:
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)\]
We define some \(H\) to be the integral of the above equation and which defines all possible solutions \(Y\) to the differential equation:
\[H(x,y) = c\]
possibly with some initial condition \(Y(x_0)=y_0\). The question then is when can we get such an \(H\)?
Assume such a \(H\) exists and that \(Y(x)\) is a solution to the differential equation.
\[H(x,y) = H(x,Y(x))\]
Then, we take the partials with respect to both \(x\) and \(y\).
\[\partial_x H(x,Y(x)) + Y&rsquo;(x)\partial_y H(x,Y(x))\]
Solving for \(Y&rsquo;(x)\), gives us:
\[Y&rsquo;(x) = \frac{dy}{dx} = - \frac{\partial_x H(x,Y(x))}{\partial_y H(x,Y(x))}\]
Since \(y=Y(x)\) is a solution and \(\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)\),
\[f(x,y) = - \frac{\partial_x H(x,y)}{\partial_y H(x,y}\]
We define some \(M(x,y) = \partial_x H(x,y)\) and some \(N(x,y) = \partial_y H(x,y)\)
\[f(x,y) = - \frac{M(x,y)}{N(x,y)}\]
Remember that we need there to be some function \(H(x,y)\) that fits our above work. Some function \(H(x,y)\) exists and the differential form is <strong>exact</strong> if \(\partial_y M(x,y) = \partial_x N(x,y)\).
If so, we can integrate either \(Mdx\) or \(Ndy\). Doing either gives us:
\[H(x,y) = g(x,y) + h\]
where \(g\) is the integral and \(h\) is some function of only the other variable. We then take the derivative of this with respect to the other variable and check it with its partial of \(H\). With that expression, we can solve for \(h\), and thereby for \(H\).</p><h3 id=informal-description>Informal Description<a href=#informal-description class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>Given some differential equation \(\frac{dy}{dt} = f(x,y)\) , we want to know when it has a solution.</p><p>It&rsquo;ll have a solution when we can get into some implicit form \(H(x,y) = c\). If we take the derivative of \(H\), we get some expression equal to \(f(x,y)\). This expression can be rewritten as \(f(x,y) = - \frac{M(x,y)}{N(x,y)}\) where \(M\) is the \(x\) partial of \(H\), and \(N\) is the \(y\) partial.</p><p>According to Euler, we can only have this hold when \(M_y = N_x\), that is, when the second order partials are the same. If they are, we can integrate \(M\) with respect to \(x\) and \(N\) with respect to \(y\) to solve for \(H\).</p><h3 id=integrating-factor>Integrating Factor<a href=#integrating-factor class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>Not all differential equations of the above form are <strong>exact</strong>. However, this does not mean they are not solveable. Some equations can multiplied through by some integrating factor \(\rho(x,y)\). The solutions to
\[M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0\]
and
\[\rho(x,y)M(x,y)dx + \rho(x,y)N(x,y)dy = 0\]
are the same. From there, since this must be exact, the second-order partials must equal, and so:
\[\partial_y[\rho(x,y)M(x,y)] = \partial_x[\rho(x,y)N(x,y)]\]
Applying the chain rule:
\[\rho_y(x,y)M(x,y) + \rho(x,y)M_y(x,y) = \rho_x(x,y)N(x,y) + \rho(x,y)N_y(x,y)\]
This is a pretty bad equation, but we can solve it if we set either partial of \(\rho\) to 0. \(\rho\) then becomes a function of only one variable, and if we can write its partial in terms of only that variable, we can find a implicit solution.</p><p>If we set \(\rho_y\) to 0:</p><p>\[\rho(x,y)M_y(x,y) = \rho_x(x,y)N(x,y) + \rho(x,y)N_x(x,y)\]
\[\rho(x,y)M_y(x,y) - \rho(x,y)N_x(x,y) = \rho_x(x,y)N(x,y)\]
\[\rho(x,y) \frac{M_y(x,y) - N_x(x,y)}{N(x,y)} = \rho_x(x,y)\]</p><p>Similarly, if we set \(\rho_x\) to 0:</p><p>\[\rho_y(x,y)M(x,y) + \rho(x,y)M_x(x,y) = \rho(x,y)N_y(x,y)\]
\[\rho_y(x,y)M(x,y) = \rho(x,y)N_x(x,y) - \rho(x,y)M_y(x,y)\]
\[\rho_y(x,y) = \rho(x,y) \frac{N_x(x,y) - M_y(x,y)}{M(x,y)}\]</p><p>From here, you can solve for \(\rho\), and then solve \(H\) where both partial components are multiplied by \(\rho\).</p><h2 id=higher-order-linear-differential-equations>Higher Order Linear Differential Equations<a href=#higher-order-linear-differential-equations class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><h3 id=definition-and-terminology>Definition and Terminology<a href=#definition-and-terminology class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>Every \(n^th\) order linear DE can be written in the form:

\[\mathbb{L} = D^n+D^{n-1}a_1(t) + &mldr; + D^1a_{n-1}(t) + a_n(t)\]
where \(D = \frac{d}{dt}\). In essence, we factor out a \(y\) to make \(\mathbb{L}\) function-agnostic. Therefore, our initial equation can be written as:
\[\mathbb{L}y = f(t)\]
\(\mathbb{L}\) is linear, meaning applying it to a linear combination of functions is the same as applying it to each one. That is:
\[\mathbb{L}(c_1y_1+c_2y_2) = \mathbb{L}c_1y_1 + \mathbb{L}c_2y_2\]</p><h3 id=superposition-principle>Superposition Principle<a href=#superposition-principle class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>Given some \(n^th\) order linear homogeneous differential equation, there are generally \(n\) solutions \(Y_1(t), Y_2(t) &mldr; Y_{n-1}(t)\).
