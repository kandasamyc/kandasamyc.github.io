a person destroys the environment for their own pleasure, and hurts no ene else, why is it wrong?</li><li>Virtue ethics says because a virtuous person would not do such a thing, it&rsquo;s his character is the issue</li></ul></li><li>Virtue ethics also struggles with tragedies of the commons<ul><li>Is it wrong to live a normal life even if that life hurts the

should become a universal law.</li><li>Put simply, something is right if the world would work if everyone did it</li><li>Preferences don&rsquo;t matter, if it can be willed it is right</li></ul></li><li>An action might be deemed wrong by a broad maxim, but a more specific one may deem it right</li><li>This leads to the question, what maxims can we trust/use?</li><li>Another formulation is the formula of humanity<ul><li>Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, as always an end and never as a means only.</li></ul></li><li>This means that we have no duties to animals as they are &ldquo;mere things&rdquo;<ul><li>Kant justifies this, saying that we care for animals because we care for ourselves and our morality</li></ul></li><li>Korsgaard says that rational agents are valueable (like Kant), but also so are their ends (because rational agents give them value)<ul><li>Since we are rational agents, and we value animalistic nature in ourselves, we must value it in animals as well</li><li>Since we value our own ends, we must value that other animals must pursue their own ends</li></ul></li><li>We need

relationships between people rather than only or primarily the rational decisions of solitary moral agents.<br>&mdash;Virginia Held</p></blockquote><ul><li>Since women have often more experience in caretaking and caring, theorists suggest that women might have more insights here, but it is not by any means limited to just women, it should be everyone</li><li>Care Ethics provide a perspective on caring for others an nature that other western philosophies may not consider</li><li>Despite care ethics promoting an emotional despite for nonhuman things, environmental ethics often glosses over it</li></ul><h4 id=care-ethics-in-indigenous-environmental-movements>Care Ethics in Indigenous Environmental Movements<a href=#care-ethics-in-indigenous-environmental-movements class=hanchor

sovereignty to help the land</li></ul></li><li>Indigenous people face being forced out of their land. their land being polluted and other health effects from pollution</li><li>Compounding pollution and colonization of lands has disproportionately affected indigenous people</li><li>Their environmental movements often highlight relation between humans and other human as well nature<ul><li>Key theme is understanding the closely tied and multidimensional relationships between humans, non human, entities and collectives</li><li>These relationships have intrinsic value as identity,community and spirituality, but also instrumental value</li><li>They&rsquo;re heavy burdens but motivate good things</li><li>Caring means a value necessary for Justice and sustainability in this case</li></ul></li><li>Despite the struggle, indigenous peoples have been fighting against organizations that have dominated them and have been winning, helping the environment</li><li>Their protests

that being a part of the environment means caring for some of it and morally have to do so</li><li>Care is often used, especially when traditional entities are referred to as sentient beings (which circumvents roadblocks in western ethics)<ul><li>Water is often shown as an example here and many declarations and other literature focuses on water as a essential part of this web, to which we both have responsibility and receive from it</li></ul></li><li>All elements of the have responsibilities toward each other here</li><li>Especially with policy, &ldquo;civil societies&rdquo; don&rsquo;t

absolute truths</li></ul><blockquote><p>Gilligan’s findings indicated that even among culturally similar (white, American, middle class) subjects, two moral “voices” or paradigms of moral reasoning are evident: one focused on impersonal justice and rule-​following, the other focused on appropriate caretaking and meeting responsibilities within specific relationships</p><p>&mdash; Whyte and Cuomo</p></blockquote><ul><li>These different views are often insightful and breaking the illusion that there is only can break gender roles and barriers in society</li><li>Using the knowledge here can build better relationship between people that does not take advantages of caretakers</li><li>These ethics are often used to care for animals and even non-sentient beings as they emphasize care for

that</li><li>In contrast to this, there are 3 reasons why that idea doesn&rsquo;t work<ol><li>Poor countries will defect if the developed don&rsquo;t pay for their actions</li><li>Sanctions will cause

allowed some level of minimum emissions that allow them to live</li><li>This implies that we may have to exceed a ceiling if it means people can live</li><li>This also implies different people will be given different amounts of emission to use</li><li>You can extend it with something else and increase slightly</li><li>Concern 1 - What is a necessity?<ul><li>What morally counts as something needed?</li><li>Does this mean we continue to live our lifestyles and change our emissions accordingly in contrast to adapting to the new world like other suggest?</li></ul></li><li>Concern 2 - It might not actually different from the first one<ul><li>Isn&rsquo;t the minimum built into the per capita one?</li><li>It&rsquo;s hard to claim necessities and defend it appropriately</li><li>It also creates political tension and would hurt poorer countries</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Priority to the Least Well-Off<ul><li>Basically offer assistance to LDCs</li><li>One version would be to help the poor now instead of their future generations which is less costly<ul><li>The issue here is that helping the poor can also be acting on climate change</li><li>It&rsquo;s also hard to convince countries to spend money on that</li></ul></li><li>Another would be to allow increases of emissions based on GDP<ul><li>An issue is how do we make sure that genuinely helps the poor</li><li>Also it&rsquo;s just better and easier to spend that money elsewhere</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Fair Chore Division<ul><li>What does this mean?</li></ul></li></ol></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div
