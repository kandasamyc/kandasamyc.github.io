# What is Version Control?

Code changes - for better, or worse

>&emsp;A well-used door needs no oil on its hinges.<br>
>&emsp;A swift-flowing stream does not grow stagnant.<br>
>&emsp;A deer blends perfectly into the forest colors.<br>
>&emsp;Software rots if not used.<br>
>&ensp;These are great mysteries.<br>
> \- The Tao of Programming, Book 5, Section 1

Version control helps you keep track of those changes

At their core, VCS or (SCM) tools track changes to sets of files

# Local Development

- Testing out ideas <!-- .element: class="fragment custom emph" data-fragment-index="0" -->
  - Software development is a non-linear process <!-- .element: class="fragment custom emph" data-fragment-index="0" -->
  - Work on multiple tasks <!-- .element: class="fragment custom emph" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- History <!-- .element: class="fragment custom emph" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  - Useful to have a log of what you did<!-- .element: class="fragment custom emph" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  - Revert to previous changes<!-- .element: class="fragment custom emph" data-fragment-index="1" -->

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
# Shared Work

- Software development is a collaborative process

It starts locally

---
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
# Shared Work

- Software development is a collaborative process
Then we have multiple people to one central location
![](images/central_dev.png) <!-- .element: data-id="devimg" -->

<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
# Shared Work

- Software development is a collaborative process
Finally, we distribute the code to multiple people

# From First Principles

---
# The (Git) Circle of Life

Git has 3 parts to the lifecycle

- The Working tree
  - The actual current changes from the latest snapshot
- The Stage
  - What you plan to take a snapshot of
- The HEAD
  - The latest snapshot you're working off of

---
# Branches on Branches

The lifecycle is especially powerful when the latest snapshot you're working off of can *change*

- Branches are named snapshots you can *checkout* to work off of
- Branches can have *divergent* history, making it neccessary to merge
- A merge commit is a special snapshot that inherits from two different snapsots

---
# Tips & Tricks

- Configuring =pull.rebase= to false makes pushing/pulling easier
- Setting the diff mode can make resolving merge conflicts a lot easier
  - try zdiff3!
